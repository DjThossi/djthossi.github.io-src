                <p>
                    Today it's crystal clear why we need unit tests.
                    Even integration and acceptance tests are quite common.
                    However, none of these tests is generally run in a production environment.
                    Well, are you sure that all your web pages are working in production after your newest feature was deployed?
                    Discover SmokeTests (as well called sanity or availability tests) and why every web development team should have them set up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to show that smoke tests are a good way to approve that all your critical URLs are working.
                    First part will be a general overview of testing website code.
                    Then SmokeTesting explained in depths including code examples for easy reuse.
                    Afterward, I will show how the workflow of deployments to production environments could look like.
                    How the correct server setup will help to get smoke tests running and how we make sure that smoke tests are not affecting the users.
